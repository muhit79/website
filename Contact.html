   <center><h3>What do you think of when you hear the phrase "great website design"? Depending on the resource assignment, you, probably, think about its homepage, maybe of its blog, its product pages, animated effects, usability, etc.

    We bet you don't think about a 'Contact Us' page of your future website.
    
    Unfortunately, very often contact pages get to the bottom of the priority list in terms of both copywriting and layout for many designers. Can you remember how many contact pages you've come across looked outdated even if the rest of the website was polished and up-to-date?
    You know, the question of the best ‘Contact Us’ page is very subjective. We mean that what is awesome for you, may appear bad or even ugly for other people.

    It's better to take into account not your personal taste and preferences, but User Experience. Please remember that a good ‘Contact Us’ page should have the following things.  
    </h3></center>

    <center><img src="Photos/contact.png" alt="contact" height="380"></center>
    
    <center><h3>As a rule, the best contact pages perform certain functions:</h3></center>
    <center><h3>+They explain why a visitor should contact you and describe how you can help to solve your visitors' problems.</h3></center>
    <center><h3>+They include an email and phone number so that the visitors could quickly find the required information.</h3></center>
    <center><h3>+They include a short form that uses fill that will help you understand who's contacting you.</h3></center>
    <center><h3>+They showcase the main company ideas. This can be done by including a list of recent blog posts or articles about the company in the press</h3></center>
    <center><h3>+They are linked to your active corporate social media accounts like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to give visitors a way to engage with your business.</h3></center>
    <center><h3>+They redirect the user to a thank-you page that explains when and how you'll contact them.</h3></center>
